    "To create a 2v2 attack game with Python, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the Character Classes:\n",
    "   - Create a base character class that includes common attributes and methods.\n",
    "   - Implement three specific character classes that inherit from the base character class, each with unique attack styles and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement Character Class Methods:\n",
    "   - In each character class, define the following methods:\n",
    "     - `__init__`: Initialize the character with a name, strength, and health.\n",
    "     - `attack()`: Return the strength of an attack.\n",
    "     - `hit(points)`: Reduce the character's health based on the strength of an attack.\n",
    "     - `isAlive()`: Return a Boolean indicating if the character's health is greater than 0.\n",
    "     - `print_info()`: Display the name, class, strength, and health of the character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a Battle Simulation:\n",
    "   - Implement a driver class that simulates a battle between two characters.\n",
    "   - You can use a simple loop to repeatedly have the characters attack each other until one character's health reaches 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Display the Winning Character:\n",
    "   - After the battle, determine the winning character by checking which character's health is still greater than 0.\n",
    "   - Display the winning character's information.\n",
